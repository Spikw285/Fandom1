                NEO'S PHONE MESSAGE FOR THE SYNTHIENTS</p>
            </div>
            <p>Neo is the main protagonist of The Matrix trilogy and a returning protagonist of The Matrix Resurrections. He is a Redpill Resistance operative of the hovercraft Nebuchadnezzar and is prophecized by The Oracle to be The One - an individual capable of freeing the rest of humanity from their unsuspecting imprisonment within the Matrix. As a former Bluepill, Neo himself was rescued from the Matrix by the Nebuchadnezzar and its crew; and with the support of Morpheus and Trinity, swiftly learns the depths of his own abilities whilst embroiled in the Machine War against the Synthient creators of the Matrix and their many Machines and Agents. Eventually discovering the truth behind the Prophecy, and facing the destruction of both Zion and the Matrix, Neo finds and walks a path to ending the centuries of war in exchange for his life.<br>
            In The Matrix Resurrections, Neo is resurrected by The Analyst and is once again re-imprisoned within the Matrix. Devoid of all his memories, another 60 years pass before Neo rediscovers his true identity after which he immediately sets out to rescue the similarly resurrected and amnesiac Trinity.</p>
            <h2>The Matrix</h2>
            <p>Thomas A. Anderson
            Neo (born Thomas A. Anderson) was one of the billions of Bluepills connected to the Matrix. As Thomas Anderson, he was a "normal citizen with a social security number" who held a day job as a computer programmer for the MetaCortex software company. However, outside of this public persona, he worked as a hacker selling contraband programming under the alias, Neo, which he later adopts as his common-use name once he got freed from the Matrix.<br>

            One night, Neo falls asleep at his desk while conducting an extensive online and periodical search for any citing of "Morpheus". The search gets interrupted as his screen blacks out beneath the message:
            <div class="quotes-section">
                <p class="quote">"Wake up, Neo..."</p>
            </div>

            As if by command, Neo wakes up and reads his screen before three more lines are delivered saying,
            <div class="quotes-section">
                <p class="quote">"The Matrix has you..."</p>
                <p class="quote">"Follow the white rabbit."</p>
                <p class="quote">"Knock, knock, Neo."</p>
            </div>
            Suddenly, a loud banging can be heard from the door and Neo is forced to get up and answer it.
            <div class="quotes-section">
            <p class="quote">"Hallelujah. You're my savior, man. My own personal Jesus Christ."<br>
            CHOI, ALLUDING TO NEO AS A MESSIAH </p>
            </div>
            Behind the door were a group of people lead by a buyer, Choi, and his girlfriend, Dujour. Neo transacts with Choi, accepting payment and handing over a disc from a hollowed-out copy of Simulacra and Simulation. Noticing Neo looking pale and troubled, Choi invites Neo along to party at a nearby club. Neo initially refuses but spots Dujour's tattoo of a white rabbit. He then decides to tag along.<br>

            At the club, Neo meets the person responsible for the messages, a hacker who calls herself Trinity. Neo recognizes her infamy at cracking the IRS D-base. But seeing Neo to be a little surprised at her identity, Trinity also recognizes that people tended to share such misconceptions about her gender. More importantly, she alleviates Neo's suspicions and alludes to the existence of the Matrix, further hinting at clues Neo is yet to discover.</p>
